# Intelligent Predictive Maintenance and Battery Health Forecasting System for Electric Vehicles

## Project Overview

This capstone project aims to architect, develop, and validate an intelligent, data-driven predictive maintenance and battery health analytics platform tailored for electric vehicles (EVs). By integrating advanced machine learning algorithms with robust data engineering pipelines, the project will forecast battery state of health (SoH) and estimate remaining useful life (RUL), enabling proactive maintenance strategies to enhance safety, reliability, and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the solution will consider socio-technical dimensions, such as user participation in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) programs, economic incentives, and regulatory frameworks, to deliver actionable, transparent, and explainable decision support for diverse stakeholders including fleet operators, manufacturers, and utility providers. This holistic framework positions the project as a strategic enabler for sustainable, efficient, and scalable EV ecosystem management.

## Problem Statement

Electric vehicles (EVs) accounted for 14 million units sold in 2023, yet battery failures and unplanned maintenance still drive over $16 billion in annual downtime and warranty costs. Simultaneously, EV owners forego $1,000–$3,000 per year by underutilizing Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) services, due to opaque incentives and battery-health concerns. Current Battery Management Systems (BMS) lack predictive insight into State of Health (SoH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL), forcing reactive maintenance and suboptimal grid interactions.
